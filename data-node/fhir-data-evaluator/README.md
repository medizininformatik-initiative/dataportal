# The Fhir-Data-Evaluator (FDE)

The FDE is used as part of the data portal to collect metadata about available data on the local FHIR server.
This data can then be sent via the DSF to the central portal or loaded into the local portal to display the availability
of single criteria in the fhir server.

For a description on how to use the FDE please refer to the main [use documentation](https://medizininformatik-initiative.github.io/dataportal/data-node/fhir-data-evaluator.html)
